// A value is a piece of information used in a computer program. Values exist in different forms called types. The type of a value determines its role and operations available to it. Every computer language has its own types and values. Letâ€™s look at two of the types available in JavaScript.

// Separate string with newline
console.log('This is \n a multiline string');

// Concat string
console.log('Hel' + 'lo');
